FORGE

This is a HyperTalk interpreter that compiles scripts into a bytecode and then
executes the "startup" handler in them. The command line tool has the following
syntax:

forge [options] <inputfile>

Where inputfile is the path to a UTF8-encoded text file that contains a valid
HyperTalk script. Currently, the following options are supported:

--debug	<host>			Try to connect to a remote debugger on startup on server
						<host>:13762. This will also set a breakpoint on the
						startUp handler's first instruction so you can step
						through the code if you desire. It is OK to pass
						127.0.0.1 here to connect to a debugger on your local
						machine, like ForgeDebugger.

--dontrun				Compile the code, but do not actually execute it (this
						also means the debugger won't have anything to debug).

--printtokens			Dump information on all tokens in the script to stdout.

--printparsetree		Dump a text description of the parse tree matching the
						given script to stdout.

--printinstructions		Dump all bytecode instructions as a sort of pseudo-
						source-code to stdout.

--verbose				Dump some additional headings and status messages to
						stdout.
						
--message <messageName>	The message to send. I.e. the name of the first handler
						to call. If this is not specified, the handler named
						"startUp" will be called.
